Hobby Tabletop GM:
To make custom tabletop maps
Existing applications are expensive and overly artistic. They are not confident in hand-crafting these maps

1) Customizable map sizes
2) Download the map made in the app
3) Allow for custom background to be used allowing existing landscape image to be built upon
4) Variety of object texture/colors to make many kinds of maps

Beginner in Indoor Design:
create a house overview map
Hope to practice computer graphics skills through the website

1) Remove the grid when not needed since it makes the display overly clutered
2) Be able to save progress and continue working on it
3) Able to upload custom props

Use as a drafting tool to build functional blocks before spending time on the detailed art
Existing tools are more purpose-built for finalized maps and may have copyright restrictions

1) Work quickly not needed to drag each square in
2) Filter for objects to keep process fast
